# `genetic_alg.py`

This is a python library created for my Advanced Software Engineering course. It provides an API for automatically generating test cases using a genetic algorithm. 

## Future Work

-   Print/Save the resulting test cases
-   Find the settings with best results
-   Create more/better test cases for evaluating the effectiveness of this program
-   Add a statement coverage fitness function
-   Add a branch coverage fitness function
